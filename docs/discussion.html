<p>The linear interaction model and the RCS-3 model both displayed very good
performance under many of the considered simulation scenarios. The linear
interaction model was optimal in cases with smaller sample sizes and moderately
performing baseline risk prediction models, that is, it had lower RMSE, was
better calibrated for benefit and had better discrimination for benefit, even in
scenarios with strong quadratic deviations. In scenarios with true non-monotonic
deviations, the linear interaction model was outperformed by RCS-3, especially
in the presence of true treatment-related harms. Increasing the sample size or
the prediction model’s discriminative ability favored RCS-3, especially in
scenarios with non-monotonic deviations and in the presence of treatment-related
harms.</p>
<p>RCS-4 and RCS-5 proved to be too flexible in all considered scenarios, as
indicated by higher RMSE, increased variability of discrimination for benefit
and worse calibration of benefit predictions. Even with larger sample sizes and
strong quadratic or non-monotonic deviations from the base case scenario of
constant relative treatment effects, these more flexible restricted cubic
splines did not outperform the simpler RCS-3. These approaches may only be
helpful if we expect more extreme patterns of heterogeneous treatment effects
compared to the quadratic deviations considered here. Considering interactions
in RCS-3 models as the most complex approach often may be reasonable.</p>
<p>The constant treatment effect model, despite having adequate performance in the
presence of weak treatment effect heterogeneity on the relative scale, quickly
broke down with stronger deviations from constant relative treatment effects. In
these cases, the stratified approach generally had lower error rates compared to
the constant treatment effect model. Such stepwise treatment benefit estimates
are useful for visually demonstrating treatment effect heterogeneity but may be
considered insufficient for making individualized benefit predictions.</p>
<p>Increasing the discriminative ability of the risk model–by increasing the
predictor coefficients of the true risk model–reduced RMSE for all methods. This
increase in discriminative ability translates in higher variability of predicted
risks, which, in turn, allows the considered methods to better capture absolute
treatment benefits. As a consequence, the increase in discriminative ability of
the risk model also led to higher discrimination between those with low or high
benefit (as reflected in values of c-for-benefit). Even though risk model
performance is very important for the ability of risk-based methods to predict
treatment benefit, prediction model development was outside the scope of this
work and has already been studied extensively <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-vanKlaveren2019" role="doc-biblioref">5</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Burke2014" role="doc-biblioref">8</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-Abadie2018" role="doc-biblioref">9</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>The adaptive approach had adequate performance, following closely on average the
performance of the “true” model in most scenarios. With smaller sample sizes it
tended to miss the treatment-risk interactions and selected simpler models
(Supplement Section 4). This conservative behavior resulted in increased RMSE
variability in these scenarios, especially in the case of true strong linear or
non-monotonic deviations from the base case scenario. Therefore, in the case of
smaller sample sizes the simpler linear interaction model may be a safer choice
for predicting absolute benefits in the presence of any suspected
treatment-related harms.</p>
<p>A limitation of our study is that we assumed treatment benefit
to be a function of baseline risk in the majority of the simulation
scenarios. We also considered constant moderate and strong treatment-related
harms, applied on the absolute scale to expand the range of scenarios in line
with previous work <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Glasziou1995" role="doc-biblioref">15</a>]</span>. In a limited set of scenarios where we
assumed the existence of true treatment-covariate interactions, our conclusions
remained unchanged. Even though the average error rates increased for all the
considered methods, due to the miss-specification of the outcome model, the
linear interaction model had the lowest error rates. RCS-3 had very comparable
performance. The constant treatment effect model often gave biased results,
espcially in the presence of moderate or strong treatment-related harms. All the
results of these simulations can be found in Supplement, Section 7. Future
simulation studies could explore the effect of more extensive deviations from
risk-based treatment effects.</p>
<p>In our simulations we only focused on risk-based methods, using baseline risk as
a reference in a two-stage approach to individualizing benefit
predictions. However, there is a plethora of different methods, ranging from
treatment effect modeling to tree-based approaches available in more recent
literature <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-Athey2019" role="doc-biblioref">16</a>–<a href="references.html#ref-powers2018some" role="doc-biblioref">19</a>]</span>. Many of these
methods rely on incorporating treatment-covariate interactions in the prediction
of benefit. An important caveat of such approaches is that they may be prone to
overfitting, thus exaggerating the magnitude of the predicted benefits. In a
wide range of simulation settings, a simpler risk modeling approach was
consistently better calibrated for benefit compared to more complex treatment
effect modelling approaches <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-vanKlaveren2019" role="doc-biblioref">5</a>]</span>. However, whether this remains
the case in a range of empirical settings still needs to be explored Similarly,
when SYNTAX score II, a model developed for identifying patients with complex
coronary artery disease that benefit more from percutaneous coronary
intervention or from coronary artery bypass grafting was redeveloped using fewer
treatment-covariate interactions had better external performance compared to its
predecessor<span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-farooq2013anatomical" role="doc-biblioref">20</a>,<a href="references.html#ref-takahashi2020redevelopment" role="doc-biblioref">21</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the linear interaction approach is a viable option with smaller
sample sizes and/or moderately performing risk prediction models if we consider
a non-constant relative treatment effect plausible. RCS-3 is a better option
when non-monotonic deviations from a constant relative treatment effect and/or
substantial treatment-related harms are anticipated. Increasing the complexity
of the RCS models by increasing the number of knots does not translate to
improved benefit prediction. Using AIC for model selection among the constant
treatment effect, the linear interaction and RCS-3 model is a viable option,
especially with larger sample size.</p>
